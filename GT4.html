        A Nash equilibrium is a strategy for each 
        player such that every players’ action is the 
        best response to the other players’ actions.
      </p>

        <h3 class = "midh3">The Problem: Hawke and Rain</h3>

        <p class="tabletext text-left">
          Hawke and Rain were childhood friends, they have been through tough and happy times together. 
          They have many shared encounters that enriched what they have right now. As they continue to move on towards 
          their lives they have realized that they like each other but are afraid to ask. Growing up, they 
          belonged in an environment where there was stigma against same-sex relationships that's why 
          they thought that what they had would be broken if one confessed, since they would just get 
          rejected (they don't know they like each other).
        </p>

        <p class="tabletext text-left">
          During the mundane moments they had, they began to take note every small thing that remind themselves 
          how they fell in love with each other. While being ignorant to their feelings, they tread on their lives 
          yet Rain's heart began to ache even more so. So much that time would eventually break him apart if he did not 
          shoot his shot against this situation.  
        </p>

        <p class="tabletext text-left">
          Hawke surrendered to the reality that what he wanted was selfish. And that he would love and respect whoever Rain gives 
          his whole life to. Hawke hoped despite this. He loved with a love that was selfless; a love that was pure.
        </p>

          Take note that the payoff values represent their happiness levels.
        </p>

        <p class="tabletext text-left">
          We can say that Rain is a guy who is full of pride (in a good way) and would like to take the lead in 
          asking Hawke out. So waiting for him doesn't give a good pay-off compared to asking Hawke out.
        </p>

        <p class="tabletext text-left">
          Hawke on the other hand, doesn't want to risk what they have right now but he still waits patiently. That's 
          why waiting for him has a higher pay-off.
        </p>

        <p class="tabletext text-left">
          this method determines the highest possible outcome in response to the other player’s action. The best 
          responses for Player 1 will be in purple, while Player 2’s will be in orange.
